XBRL tag grouping
This json defines groups for few selected XBRL tags. 
The grouping aims at serving discounted free cashflow (DFCF) valuation. Therefore only those few tags that are relevant for DFCF are standardized here.
This grouping may include tags that are relevant in US SEC XBRL disclosures as well as in European style ESEF disclosures.
